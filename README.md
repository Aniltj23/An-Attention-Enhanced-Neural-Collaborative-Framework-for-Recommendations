# Key Features
- Attention-Aware Fusion between MF and MLP branches for adaptive learning
- Personalized Top-N Movie Recommendations
- Enhanced Diversity, Novelty, and Serendipity using embedding-based metrics
- Interactive Streamlit Deployment Ready for real-time inference

# How Diversity, Novelty and Serendipity works
- Diversity — penalizes similarity among recommended items using cosine distance in embedding space
- Diversity — penalizes similarity among recommended items using cosine distance in embedding space
- Serendipity — combines diversity and novelty for unexpected yet relevant recommendations
